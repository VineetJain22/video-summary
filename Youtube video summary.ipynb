      "- India's historic relationship with Africa has been revitalized through this inclusion, and Indian businesses will be more welcome in Africa than ever before.\n",
      "- China's approach to Africa has been focused on extractive businesses and securing contracts, leading to indebtedness in African countries.\n",
      "- India, on the other hand, has provided technology support, diplomatic and political support, and soft loans and grants without extracting minerals and metals from Africa.\n",
      "- Doing business in Africa has its challenges, such as infrastructure and currency depreciation, but the continent offers immense potential for growth.\n",
      "- The B20 Africa Integration Council focused on improving cross-border business within the African Union and highlighted agriculture and digital development as key areas.\n",
      "- Africa's growing population, particularly its young population, makes it an attractive market for goods and services.\n",
      "- India's leadership in relation to Africa holds promise for Indian businesses, and those looking to expand outside of India should focus on Africa.\n",
      "- The world is waking up to the potential of Africa, with President Biden committing $55 billion to Africa in the next three years.\n",
